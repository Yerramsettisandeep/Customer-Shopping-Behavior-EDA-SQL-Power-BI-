Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
End-to-End Data Analytics Project

Python → SQL → Power BI

📌 Project Objective

This project analyzes how customers behave in an online retail business.

The main goal was to answer:

Who are our customers?

Which category drives the most revenue?

Are frequent customers more valuable?

How strong is customer retention?

Where does the business have growth opportunities?

Instead of jumping directly into dashboards, this project follows a structured analytics pipeline:

🐍 Python (Exploration)
🗄 SQL (Structured Analysis)
📊 Power BI (Business Intelligence & Storytelling)

🐍 Phase 1: Python – Exploratory Data Analysis

The first step was understanding the raw dataset.

Using Python, the data was:

Cleaned (null values handled)

Columns standardized

Data types validated

Basic statistics calculated

Customer distribution explored

Category contribution analyzed

Frequency behavior reviewed

What Python Helped Discover

Total Customers: 3,900

Average Purchase Amount: $59.76

Average Review Rating: 3.8

Male customers form the majority

Clothing appears to be a dominant category

Python helped validate the data quality and uncover early behavioral patterns before moving into deeper analysis.

🗄 Phase 2: SQL – Business Question Solving

After understanding the dataset, SQL was used to answer structured business questions.

This phase focused on:

Total revenue calculation

Revenue by category

Customer frequency distribution

Previous purchase behavior

Subscription analysis

Aggregated customer insights

Key Business Findings from SQL

Total Revenue: $233K

Clothing contributes $104K (45%) of revenue

Footwear contributes $74K (32%)

27% customers are subscribed

73% customers are non-subscribed

Higher frequency customers show higher repeat purchases

SQL confirmed that repeat behavior is not random — it is predictable and segment-driven.

📊 Phase 3: Power BI – Business Intelligence Layer

After validation through Python and SQL, Power BI was used to build interactive dashboards that communicate insights clearly.

Two separate dashboards were created to tell different business stories.

📈 Dashboard 1: Revenue & Customer Overview


This dashboard focuses on overall business performance.

Core Metrics

Total Customers: 3,900

Total Revenue: $233K

Average Purchase: $59.76

Average Rating: 3.8

Subscription Rate: 27%

Category Performance

Clothing: $104K (45%)

Footwear: $74K (32%)

Accessories: $36K (15%)

Outerwear: $19K (8%)

Key Insight

The business heavily depends on Clothing, which contributes nearly half of total revenue.

This dashboard answers:

Where does revenue come from?

Which segments are strong?

What drives overall performance?

🔁 Dashboard 2: Customer Frequency Behavior Analysis

<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (131)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a52bcf15-fec5-4f42-873c-89c4d6d8ab44" />

This dashboard focuses entirely on customer behavior and retention.

Customer Distribution by Frequency

Low: 1,147

Frequent: 1,089

Very Low: 572

Moderate: 553

Very Frequent: 539

Previous Purchase Behavior

Low segment: 30K previous purchases

Frequent segment: 27K

Other segments: ~14K each

Key Behavioral Insight

Frequent and Very Frequent customers generate significantly higher historical purchases.

This confirms:

Retention drives revenue.

The largest opportunity lies in converting:

Low → Frequent
Frequent → Very Frequent

📩 Subscription Analysis

Subscribed Customers: ~1.1K

Non-Subscribed Customers: ~2.8K

Subscription Rate: 27%

Most customers are not subscribed.

This represents a major untapped retention opportunity.

🧠 Final Business Diagnosis

This project reveals three major insights:

1️⃣ Revenue is Category-Driven

Clothing dominates revenue contribution.

2️⃣ Revenue is Retention-Driven

Higher frequency customers generate consistent repeat purchases.

3️⃣ Growth Opportunity Exists

A large portion of customers are low-frequency and non-subscribed.

Improving retention strategies could significantly increase revenue.

📌 Observations & Insights
🔍 Key Observations

The total customer base consists of 3,900 customers, indicating a moderately sized active user base.

Total revenue generated is $233K, showing consistent transaction flow across categories.

The Clothing category contributes 45% ($104K) of total revenue, making it the primary revenue driver.

Footwear contributes 32% ($74K), while Accessories and Outerwear together contribute only 23%, showing revenue concentration in top two categories.

The average purchase value is $59.76, indicating stable and consistent customer spending behavior.

The average review rating is 3.8, reflecting moderate-to-high customer satisfaction.

The largest customer segments are:

Low Frequency: 1,147 customers

Frequent: 1,089 customers

This shows a large group of customers who purchase occasionally but are not yet highly loyal.

Only 27% of customers are subscribed, while approximately 73% are non-subscribed, highlighting low adoption of retention programs.

📊 Behavioral Insights
1️⃣ Revenue is Concentrated

Nearly half of the total revenue comes from one category (Clothing).
This indicates dependency risk — if Clothing performance declines, overall revenue will be heavily impacted.

2️⃣ Retention Drives Revenue

Customers in higher frequency segments show significantly higher repeat purchases.

This confirms:

Repeat purchasing behavior is structured and predictable.

Frequent and Very Frequent customers are long-term revenue assets.

3️⃣ Low-Frequency Customers Represent Growth Potential

The largest group (1,147 customers) falls under the Low segment.

This presents a strong opportunity:

Convert Low → Frequent

Increase repeat engagement through offers and loyalty programs

4️⃣ Subscription Adoption is Weak

With only 27% subscription rate:

A majority of customers are not part of retention programs.

There is high potential to increase lifetime value through subscription incentives.

5️⃣ Stable Satisfaction but Room for Improvement

Average rating of 3.8 suggests customers are generally satisfied but not highly delighted.

Improving customer experience could:

Increase ratings above 4.0

Strengthen retention

Boost repeat purchase frequency

🎯 Strategic Business Insights

Focus marketing spend on high-performing categories (Clothing & Footwear).

Implement loyalty strategies targeting Low and Moderate segments.

Increase subscription adoption through checkout prompts and exclusive offers.

Develop personalized promotions for Frequent customers.

Reduce dependency risk by strengthening lower-performing categories.
